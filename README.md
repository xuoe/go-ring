[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/xuoe/go-ring.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/xuoe/go-ring)

This library provides a generic ring buffer implementation.

A ring buffer offers a window over a stream of values. New values are pushed at 
one end (the head), while older ones are discarded from the other end (the 
tail) to accommodate the new ones.

Check [the documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/xuoe/go-ring) for the API.
